    Hello, we are computer science students doing a data analysis project for our Digital Archeology class at the University of Tennessee. We're collecting data
    regarding the first language developers learn. We detected the language(s): LANGUAGES as the primary language(s) in the first commit that you made to a public repo. 
    We are trying to determine the reliability of using first commits to identify an authors first language and would appreciate if you would help us in our research! 
    Please respond with yes or no whether any of the language(s) listed reflect the first language that you learned.
    We appreciate your participation in our research project!
    (Or just reading :-)) 

Regards
