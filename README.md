# This was my teams final project for Fundamentals of Digital Archeology
I worked on this project with John Carmac @Pokemonpower92, Brandon Mingledorff @mingledorff, and Lilly Coar @PricklySaguaro. I wrote all the scripts in the [Authors](https://github.com/dlomax64/DIR/tree/main/Authors) directory. My role in this project was the use the World of Code (https://worldofcode.org) database to compile a list of authors first and latest commit and track their progression from one language to another using these metrics. We then compared them to the current industry to determine if there was tendancy a for developers to gravitate towards learning languages that were more in demand.


# DIR: Developer Industry Readiness 
An analysis on the languages that developers learn, why they learn them, and how prepared they make them for the industry.
